Tried of wandering 10K blocks or scouring coastlines for flux? Looking to see the next surface rock type over the next hill, and not the next ocean?

Install TFCGyres-RockLayerSize, and your trips will be 50% shorter, or your money back!

This is a lowcode mod/datapack to decrease the rock layer sizes by a factor of 2 for the TerraFirmaCraft overworld.

Concept originally from Per Fabrica Ad Astra's TFC patch in 1.7.10. TFC 1.12 and 1.18 have this change as an option,
so this mod flips that switch in an easy to apply fashion for 1.18.

This is recommended for single player (SSP) mode and for anyone else who wants lower exploration requirements.

Implements the datapack rock_layer_settings option as shown here:  https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Documentation/1.18.x/worldgen/dimension/#rock-layer-settings
